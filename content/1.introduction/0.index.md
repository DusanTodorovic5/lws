# Little Web Services

Little Web Service is a non-profitable project to test our skills in networking and golang development.
<br>
The goal of this project is to create simple IaaT(Infrastructure as a Service) and SaaS(Software as a Service) using Go programming language.  

The users of our service should be able to upload their web service, use our non-relational database and use cloud storage similar to Google Drive. Everything will be regulated with gateway which will not only direct the traffic but also create billing to users with amount depending on usage of their web services. 
<br>
As you can all conclude based on text above, the project will have 8 main parts. We can look at them all as separate services, all named by greek/roman god. Those services being:

::list{icon="ph:arrow-right-light"}
- [Jupiter](/services/jupiter) - Cloud storage API
- [Minerva](/services/minerva) - Database API
- [Vulcan](/services/vulcan) - Third-Party Service Manager API
- [Mercury](/services/mercury) - Gateway, Authentication and Statistics API
- [Portunus - Cloud storage web application]{.text-amber-600 .dark:text-amber-300} :icon{name="ðŸš§"}

- [Juno - Third-Party Managment web application]{.text-amber-600 .dark:text-amber-300} :icon{name="ðŸš§"}
- [Venus - Main web application]{.text-amber-600 .dark:text-amber-300} :icon{name="ðŸš§"}

::Alert
Note that this specification is subject to change, and will certainly be modified in future!

::Alert{type="warning"}
Frontend services will be done at later stage of the project ðŸš§

## Jupiter - Cloud storage API

Jupiter is API used for managing users and their storage. The user will have ability to host public and private files. User will have ability to share files only with certain people. Maximum size of local storage will be upgradable.
People working on this project will be:

::list{type="success"}
 - Bogdan
 - Marko
 - Mateja
 - Marija
 - Teodora
::

Jupiter should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``/``PUT``] Request for uploading file to cloud storage
 2. [``POST``/``PUT``] Request for updating file to cloud storage, preserving the link from old file
 3. [``GET``] Request for receiving all data for logged user or avaliable folder
 4. [``GET``] Request for getting avaliable(free) space and space taken by file
 5. [``POST``] Request for creating database specified by Minerva API
 6. [``POST``] Request for deleting selected file
 7. [``POST``] Request for creating user space, afterwards avaliable for user to upload files to
 8. [``POST``] Request for sharing file for given account name or adding new account to list of users
 9. [``POST``] Increasing/Decreasing avaliable data for upgraded users

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. Controlling the internal structure of file-system, something like unix-like(Linux e.g.) systems directories. Basically meaning each user can have his own directory, and can access only that directory, while he can also see shared directories of other users. This means that engineers working on this service needs to implement some type of user privileges, possibly just by using authentication header.
 2. Internally, this service should be able to host any type of file, but should check the size of those files and should terminate uploaded or expansion of those files that exceed the total maximum size that is avaliable for user.

## Minerva - Database API

Database solution which is offered using our services will be simple document NoSQL database. Users will have the ability to initiate simple queries using this API. Integration of this database will be used for authentication of users using our services, too. Tokenizer should be implemented with this API.
People working on this project will be:

::list{type="success"}
 - Filip
 - Emilija
 - Comi
 - Stefan
 - Andrijana
::

Minerva should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``] Request for creating empty database
 2. [``GET``] Request for getting data for given query
 3. [``POST``] Request for sending query that modifies database(like ALTER, INSERT, DROP, DELETE equivalent of Relational Databases)

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. Internal NoSQL database implementation and handling the queries, mongoDB can be used
 2. Queries should be custom, meaning engineers working on this service should create grammar, parser and lexer for new query language that has the ability to translate to mongoDB query language.

## Vulcan - Third-Party Service Manager API

Cloud computing offered is called Vulcan. Users can have the ability to upload their dockerfile and source code and run their own application trough our services. Usually, the users should not upload stuff like this, but in order to simplify this part of project, users must upload dockerfile(yaml configuration) and application's source code.
People working on this project will be:

::list{type="success"}
 - Amela
 - Lea
 - Mirko
 - Pavle
 - Dragan

Vulcan should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``/``PUT``] Request for uploading archive with required dockerfile and other files for starting program on docker container
 2. [``GET``] Request for getting CPU/RAM usage for given container

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. Internal managment and monitoring of containers, can be done using some type of docker swarm
 2. Calculating CPU/RAM usage for containers, can be extracted using docker's own stastics.
 3. Algorithm and functions to create whole docker file and communicate with them
 4. This part might be tricky, but engineers here should create a way to expose port for Docker rest api on local network so Mercury can target it. I assume Mercury service should create some sub-domain for that service. Will be investigated

## Mercury - Gateway, Authentication and Statistics API

The gates of our server are called Mercury. This service will manage rest calls sent to users applications or database. At the same time, this API will calculate how much traffic is used by each user and initiate a bill. This service should also handle authentication of users that want to host on our server.
People working on this project will be:

::list{type="success"}
 - Sofija
 - Aleksa
 - Bojana
 - Jelena
 - Gazmend

Mercury should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``] Request for creating account on LWS
 2. [``POST``] Request for signing in on LWS
 3. [``GET``] Request for receiving current data plan and avaliable services
 4. [``GET``] Request for receiving current account balance
 5. [``POST``] Request for updating password
 6. [``POST``] Request for updating username
 7. [``POST``] Request for updating email
 8. [``GET``] Request for receiving account statistics and usage of account's services
 9. [``POST``] Request for validating authentication header

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. This is basically the main part of service, the gate of all other services. This means that except of other requests, this app should send emails to clients with news update for their account(statistic and balance).
 2. Should be able to route and navigate to subdomains made for cloud storage, database and micro services hosted by Vulcan.
 3. Authentication should be checked by this part of LWS, meaning this service needs to generate token for user, that user will send to header, service will check if it is right and proceed to forward the request to further service.
 4. There should be a good algorithm for calulating how much data is used by given service(requests sent to Vulcan). E.g. Should not calculate with number of requests and instead should be done with number of responses
 5. Should manage the database created by Minerva system.
