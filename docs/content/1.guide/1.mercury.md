# Mercury - Gateway, Authentication and Statistics API - Specification

Mercury should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``] Request for creating account on LWS
 2. [``POST``] Request for signing in on LWS
 3. [``GET``] Request for receiving current data plan and avaliable services
 4. [``GET``] Request for receiving current account balance
 5. [``POST``] Request for updating password
 6. [``POST``] Request for updating username
 7. [``POST``] Request for updating email
 8. [``GET``] Request for receiving account statistics and usage of account's services
 9. [``POST``] Request for validating authentication header

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. This is basically the main part of service, the gate of all other services. This means that except of other requests, this app should send emails to clients with news update for their account(statistic and balance).
 2. Should be able to route and navigate to subdomains made for cloud storage, database and micro services hosted by Vulcan.
 3. Authentication should be checked by this part of LWS, meaning this service needs to generate token for user, that user will send to header, service will check if it is right and proceed to forward the request to further service.
 4. There should be a good algorithm for calulating how much data is used by given service(requests sent to Vulcan). E.g. Should not calculate with number of requests and instead should be done with number of responses
 5. Should manage the database created by Minerva system.
