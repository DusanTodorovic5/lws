# Vulcan - Third-Party Service Manager API - Specification

Vulcan should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``/``PUT``] Request for uploading archive with required dockerfile and other files for starting program on docker container
 2. [``GET``] Request for getting CPU/RAM usage for given container

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. Internal managment and monitoring of containers, can be done using some type of docker swarm
 2. Calculating CPU/RAM usage for containers, can be extracted using docker's own stastics.
 3. Algorithm and functions to create whole docker file and communicate with them
 4. This part might be tricky, but engineers here should create a way to expose port for Docker rest api on local network so Mercury can target it. I assume Mercury service should create some sub-domain for that service. Will be investigated
