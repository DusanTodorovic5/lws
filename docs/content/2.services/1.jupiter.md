# Jupiter - Cloud storage API - Specification

Jupiter should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``/``PUT``] Request for uploading file to cloud storage
 2. [``POST``/``PUT``] Request for updating file to cloud storage, perserving the link from old file
 3. [``GET``] Request for receiving all data for logged user or avaliable folder
 4. [``GET``] Request for getting avaliable(free) space and space taken by file
 5. [``POST``] Request for creating database specified by Minerva API
 6. [``POST``] Request for deleting selected file
 7. [``POST``] Request for creating user space, afterwards avaliable for user to upload files to
 8. [``POST``] Request for sharing file for given account name or adding new account to list of users
 9. [``POST``] Increasing/Decreasing avaliable storage space for upgraded users

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. Controlling the internal structure of file-system, something like unix-like(Linux e.g.) systems directories. Basically meaning each user can have his own directory, and can access only that directory, while he can also see shared directories of other users. This means that engineers working on this service needs to implement some type of user privileges, possibly just by using authentication header.
 2. Internally, this service should be able to host any type of file, but should check the size of those files and should terminate uploaded or expansion of those files that exceed the total maximum size that is avaliable for user.
