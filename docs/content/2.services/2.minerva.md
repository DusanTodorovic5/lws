# Minerva - Database API - Specification

Minerva should be implemented as REST API Server, with functional requirements being:
 1. [``POST``] Request for creating empty database
 2. [``GET``] Request for getting data for given query
 3. [``POST``] Request for sending query that modifies database(like ALTER, INSERT, DROP, DELETE equivalent of Relational Databases)

Except for given request, this service should realize the following features:
 1. Internal NoSQL database implementation and handling the queries, mongoDB can be used
 2. Queries should be custom, meaning engineers working on this service should create grammar, parser and lexer for new query language that has the ability to translate to mongoDB query language.
